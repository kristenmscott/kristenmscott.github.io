abstract: >-
    In machine learning (ML) using tabular data the attributes selected to represent individuals are operationalizations of individuals' characteristics and life circumstances. Representations are not replications and there is always a discrepancy between the representation and that which is represented. This thesis expands this premise into an examination of computational representations of social data for decision making including of differing disciplinary approaches to the question of algorithmic harms.
