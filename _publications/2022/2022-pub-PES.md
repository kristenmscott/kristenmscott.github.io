  Data-driven and algorithmic systems have been introduced to support Public Employment Services (PES) throughout Europe, and globally, and have often been met with critique and controversy. Here we draw attention to the needs and expectations of people directly affected by these systems, i.e., jobseekers. We contrast our findings from a workshop with topic experts with needs expressed by migrant job seekers and map these to three design considerations for data-driven and algorithmic systems for PES - we argue that the limitations and risks of current systems cannot be addressed through minor adjustments but require a more fundamental change to the role of PES, and algorithmic systems within it.
