  Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are intended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek support from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit, non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureaucratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search. Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1) the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology. We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritising jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods, and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers.
