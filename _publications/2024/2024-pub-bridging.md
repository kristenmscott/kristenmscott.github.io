abstract: >-
    A working group with an ostensible focus on the use of research and quantitative methods for social good reflects on our experience of conducting conversations with practitioners from a range of different backgrounds, including refugee rights, conservation, addiction counseling, and municipal data science. We consider the lessons that emerged and the impact of these conversations on our work, the potential roles we can serve as researchers, and the challenges we anticipate as we move forward in these collaborations.
