    The field of fair AI aims to counter biased algorithms through computational modelling. However, it faces increasing criticism for perpetuating the use of overly technical and reductionist methods. In this paper, we study the tension between computer science (CS) and socially-oriented and interdisciplinary (SOI) research we observe within the emerging field of fair AI. We draw on the concepts of  'organizational alignment' and 'doability' to discuss how organizational conditions, articulation work, and ambiguities of the social world constrain the doability of SOI research for CS researchers.
