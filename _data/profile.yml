  <p>
     I received a PhD from KU Leuven, Department of Computer Science, where my dissertation work focused on questions of access, equity, and social impact in relation to (algorithmic) technologies, particularly on biased representations of people in data.
  </p>
  <p>
   I am interested in effectively involving impacted persons in the design of algorithmic systems, as well as the genuine incorporation of justice-oriented design principles in tangible AI tools. I take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from fields including Science Technology Studies and Human-Computer-Interaction.
