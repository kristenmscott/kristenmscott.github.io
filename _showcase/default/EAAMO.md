    <p class="card-text">
      From 2022 to 2025 I co-organized the group <a href="https://bridges.eaamo.org/working_groups/conversations-with-practitioners/">Conversations with Practitioners</a> under <a href="https://bridges.eaamo.org/">EAAMO Bridges</a>. We interviewed people who work directly with marginalized groups about their day to day realities and challenges. In 2024 / 2025 we worked closely with one organization, <a href="https://www.chayn.co">Chayn</a>, which works in the gender based violence space. Together we developed a Principles to Practice framework based on Chayn's trauma informed design principles, started a 'Feminist AI' Working Group, and engaged in deep exploration of questions of safety and harm when using AI technologies for supporting survivors.
