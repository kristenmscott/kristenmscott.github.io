    <p class="card-text">
      From 2022 to 2025 I co-organized the group [Conversations with Practitioners](https://bridges.eaamo.org/working_groups/conversations-with-practitioners/) under [EAAMO Bridges](https://bridges.eaamo.org/). We interviewed people who work directly with marginalized groups about their day to day realities and challenges. In 2024 / 2025 we worked closely with one organization, [Chayn](https://www.chayn.co), which works in the gender based violence space. Together we developed a Principles to Practice framework based on Chayn's trauma informed design principles, started a 'Feminist AI' Working Group, and engaged in deep exploration of questions of safety and harm when using AI technologies for supporting survivors.
