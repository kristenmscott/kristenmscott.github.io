    <h5 class="card-title">Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments for AI</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
 <p>
        This is an investigation into the implementation of Article 27 of the AI Act, which requires a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) prior to deploying high-risk AI systems in public services, banking, and insurance. This was conducted in partnership with the <a href="https://cecu.es">Federaci√≥n de Consumidores y Usuarios (CECU)</a>. We conducted expert interviews with academics, public administration officers, representatives from civil society organisations, and an investigative journalist as well as consulting a wide range of relevant documentation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The initial output is a report and an advocacy brief on the question of how to ensure that Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments are completed in a way that meaningfully protects fundamental rights. We highlight how diverse public participation in these processes, and effective transparency mechanisms, ensure oversight and enforcement are essential components of a meaningful Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment.
